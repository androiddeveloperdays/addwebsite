__Tell us a little bit about your average Android development day or your work day :)__

My working day is very unique in the Android developer ecosystem, as a part of a wonderful company called Vidmind (http://www.vidmind.com/). I start my day really early (6:00 in the office) in order to talk to our hardware manufacturer in China, then I make sure that all my developers have all that they need to deliver what we planned (we work in the agile SCRUM methodology) and performing code reviews for the past day's commits to make sure all is according to the guidelines. After that is done I have time for technical research and POCs for future features and versions. When the day is done and I get back home I work on my community content such as lectures, open source code contributions, blog posts, and tutorials.

**What would you say are the ingredients for a successful app?**

Creation of a successful app is not science, an app could be perfectly designed and engineered to display a beautiful and flawlessly performing UI without any hiccups but still fail. I believe that the most basic prerequisite to success is in knowing your audience and making a product tailored to what they want without them asking for it in a flawless way.

**What your talk at ADD this year will be about?**

I have a recurring theme in all of my created content which is areas of the Android ecosystem which are useful and important but not well covered because they're not flashy or sexy which means that most developers fail to understand how to use them correctly or even what these components are capable of, one of these areas is the Android Monitor toolkit.

**Youâ€™ll be sharing some useful tips and tricks on how stability and performance of the apps can and should be improved. What are some most common pitfalls?**

Pitfalls are aplenty, I do a lot of mentoring sessions for developers and startups and I see a lot of mistakes, mostly caused by knowledge gaps, here are some of the biggest:
Documentation; Google created a few checklists and guidelines backed by many UI/UX user tests, application case-studies and a lot of market research which makes them excellent learning tools.
Testing and QA; you have many tools to test and analyze your app's performance and stability - use them.
Test your users usage of the app in the field with Google analytics or any other 3rd party tools (like TestFairy) to see what the users actually use and how much they use it.
Google Play A/B testing - use your analytics data to give different users different experience to test which one works best.
Version as many resources as possible by language, screen size, dpi, form factor and more to give the best experience to every user on every device.

**You were selected by Google as one of the Android GDEs. What your developer life was like since then: projects, conferences - we want to hear!**

Being part of the developer's expert program is wonderful, I've given many sessions in events such as DroidCon, CodeMotion, appsWorld, AppsMania and, of course, GDG events, I have held many mentoring sessions with hundreds of startups and developers and have written many posts and tutorials but the best thing are the people that you meet, be it at Google, fellow GDEs or developers I'm always humbled and inspired by the amount of talent and passion I find in almost everyone I meet which is also what drives me to try and give a little bit more every day.

**What are you most looking forward to at ADD?**

Building on my response to the last question, what I'm looking forward to the most is to meet the people.
As your neighbor in the Middle East I have the utmost respect and a lot of appreciation to Turkey and its amazing people which makes me brimming with excitement at all the wonderful things that your community must have and that I'm dying to know and learn.
