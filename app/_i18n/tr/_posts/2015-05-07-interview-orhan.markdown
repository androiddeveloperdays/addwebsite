**Tell us a little bit about your average Android development day or your work day :)**

**Orhan:**I start the day with the news, feeds and social media about what is going on around the world in order to be up-to-date. It is not just technology related, though mostly are. I think being up-to-date is the most important thing to improve yourself. Then daily standup, grab a coffee and the coding session starts. I can't say that I code all day, usually there are discussions about the code quality or best practices. My motto is If I feel something is not OK, even a little bit, I always do a research and try to find the best possible solution. Otherwise I don't think this profession would be fun :) We have a review system in the company and it's really amazing how much you can learn by simply reviewing someone else' code. If you want to know how much you are good at development, just check some good repositories in the github and then realize how much more you really need to learn. I learn a lot by doing mistakes, I think that's the only way for me to learn something permanently. We always refactor our code and try to use new technologies as much as possible. In a daily work, there are always some codes that I change or remove.  That's the daily work for me. Then we usually finish the day by playing soccer table. 

**What would you say are the ingredients for a successful app?**

**Orhan:**Simplicity, stability and speed. If the app is not fast enough, users hate it. If the app is not stable (crashes, inconsistent data etc), users hate it. If the app is too complex, not smart enough, users hate it and the worst part is if the users don't like something they explicitly show it in the play store and then the life becomes painful. In order to prevent this, we really focus on stability, speed and simplicity. 

**What your talk at ADD this year will be about?**

**Orhan:**I'll be speaking about how to design a good structure by following design/software principles and how to increase the code readability and quality by following best practices. I'll try to explain our solutions against the problems we always face during the development.

**Your talk aims to show the problem Android developers face in their daily work and the solutions to those problems that work. So what is the problem #1?**

**Orhan:**The biggest problem is using the first solution that comes to the mind. If you don't try to find a better solution for the current problem, it will be always there and it doesn't matter how many years you work, the level still will be the same. Development should be something that whenever you look at your old code, you should always say, "hmm, I could have done this better". Otherwise we are no different than a broken music box that keeps playing the same song over and over again. In order to enjoy and learn at the same time, you need a good team. I believe that if you do something alone, the quality will be 10, but if you do it with someone else, the quality will be 30 because of the sharing. 

**Youâ€™re working at Rocket Internet in Berlin. What is your favorite part about working as a Android developer in this company so far?**

**Orhan:**Rocket-Internet has the fastest pace environment I have ever seen so far. Rocket-Internet basically creates companies and as mobile developers we have to provide a good, stable product, because the success relies on the product heavily. The code quality must be good and also we need to find really good solutions by considering every possibility. One day product manager can come and tell you that there are some radical changes. If you don't have a flexible structure, it is over. This seems so much stress but with a good team and colleagues, it is fun and also very educational. I learn a lot and every day I feel that I have to learn more and more.

**What are you most looking forward to at ADD?**

**Orhan:**ADD is a very good opportunity to grasp a huge information in a very short time. I am very excited to see many fellow eager developers like me. I'd like meet as many as people and share the same feeling we all do.
