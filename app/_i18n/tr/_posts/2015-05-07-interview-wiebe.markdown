**Tell us a little bit about your average Android development day or your work day :)**

**Wiebe:**I don't think I have what you can call an "average" (work) day. Every day holds new challenges and/or different content. I'm at the office early so I can start designing and/or developing Android applications without to much distraction. I work at a small company that makes IOS and Android applications, mostly "Business to Business" applications. I love the challenges of translating user (and client) expectations into a well designed and running application. Besides my "day job" I'm also actively co-organizing a GDG (GDG Dutch Android User Group).
Well, there is one consistent factor, I enjoy exploring all aspects of Android and sharing these adventures online/offline (as GDE/GDG).

**What would you say are the ingredients for a successful app?**

**Wiebe:**There is no golden rule in creating a successful app. It all depends on the functionality, audience, and the time (even money) you are willing to spend. 
But if I would need to give some tips: Focus, Analyze, Think and Add. If you want to know more, come to ADD and find out.

**What your talk at ADD this year will be about?**

**Wiebe:**These days a good application is not good enough anymore, is has to be great.  My talk, called "Design a better (U)Xperience", will (hopefully) give you some insight on how to improve your application design. I will also be explaining good and bad UX practice.

**With your talk, youâ€™re planning to inspire us to create not just functional but also beautiful Android apps. In your opinion, can every developer learn this or do we need a special talent for this?**

**Wiebe:**Yes, there is always something you can learn or take away to improve your skills. But it's not always best to want to do everything. Everybody has a natural skill set or passion. Some things you like, some you don't. I've learned that you want to focus on what you like and what you are good at.

**You were selected by Google as one of the Android GDEs. What your developer life was like since then: projects, conferences - we want to hear!**

**Wiebe:**To be honest, not much. Before I became a GDE, I was already visiting conferences, sharing my experiences with people online/offline, and helping the community. And I think this is as it should be for all. 
It's like a fellow GDE recently told me: "You are a GDE before you become one". But I do had the chance to meet new people that have inspired me, like fellow GDEs, and had some great discussions along the way.

**What are you most looking forward to at ADD?**

**Wiebe:**That's an easy one to answer, the people. This will be my second time at ADD, so I will be seeing some friends again and am hoping to make new ones. 
Also having great discussions, as there is so much talent Turkey. A conference is a good way to learn new technology, meet experts and just having a good time. And ADD delivers on all.
