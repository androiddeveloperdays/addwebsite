Implementing basic authentication is an easy solution for developers but comes with several pitfalls that impair user experience like (re-)entering passwords, the need to create a new unique password or even just the input of personal data on a flaky keyboard while registering a new account.In this talk the security flaws and UX implications of passwords will be discussed and Tim will highlight which different techniques exist that are able to offer a more mobile friendly flow. Highlighting authorization and authentication techniques like OAuth, OpenID Connect and even hardware features like Bluetooth Low Energy this talk will be interesting for anyone who's facing a situation where creating and storing user accounts matters."

    title: "Developing Reusable Software Components Using MVP, Observer and Mediator Patterns"
    description: "Having a layered architecture brings several benefits to software development, some of which are;1. Developers can apply unit testing on every layer separately,2. Each layer can be developed by those who are really experienced with the technologies used in each layer,3. It becomes possible to reuse components created in each layer accross different systems. It is a very common practice to employ classical three tier layered architecture to separate UI, business and data access parts from each other. However, in order to achieve true modularity and reusability, we need to create some other architecture on top of the layered architecture to handle functional aspects which are usually cross­cutting those three layers. It is possible to create such an architecture which provides a basis for a modular and reusable component based architecture, by employing model­view­presenter (MVP), observer and mediator patterns together. Indeed, some frameworks in Java EE ecosystem help us to easily realize such an architecture in our projects. MVP helps us to separate handling backend logic from UI rendering completely. Any UI event, such as button click, list select etc, is immediately translated into a corresponding business event, and is let to be circulated among other components via Observer and Mediator patterns. Those other components are able to handle business events that they are interested in, execute their functionalities, publish new business events, update UI and so on. Similar modularity can also be achieved in service layer as well. Service beans can be decleratively configured to publish business events at different steps during execution of their methods. Those other components which need to involve in those service method calls can handle those events and execute their own logic. Both event source and event target components are totally unaware of each other. They can be introduced into the system optionally, and even at run time. As a result, it becomes possible to achieve modularity and reusability both on micro and macro level in our enterprise applications."

Since mutual communication must be done through secure channels that don’t allow third people to intervene, it is very important to make the security levels of these channels as high as possible. Of all security methods, the encryption algorithms have a great importance. These algorithms are ranked according to their complexity and resist by the rate of their complexity and power from the moment seized by third people who can penetrate mutual communication. In our study, we will issue which methods are used for message encryption security, how mutual messaging infrastructure is created on mobile devices with the android operating system via the internet and how to do encryption and decryption process. We will explain performance analysis of encryption algorithms on the mobile platform also discuss advantages and disadvantages to each other."
